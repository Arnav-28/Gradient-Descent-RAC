# Gradient-Descent-RAC
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of gradient descent to fit a quadratic curve to a dataset and creates an animated visualization to understand the optimization process. The code can be adapted to different datasets and regression techniques for various predictive tasks.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to your specific needs and datasets.
